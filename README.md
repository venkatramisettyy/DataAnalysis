Data Analysis using RDD in Spark
RDDs are used for data analysis in Spark because they enable distributed computing, and handle failures.
Allow in-memory processing, offer data transformations, and support multiple programming languages. 
They make data analysis faster, more efficient, and more scalable.
Data Transformation and Actions: RDD provides a rich set of transformations and actions that allow for flexible data manipulation and analysis. Transformations like map, filter, join, and aggregate can be applied to RDDs to transform and reshape the data. 
Actions like count, collect and reduce can be used to retrieve results or trigger computations.
